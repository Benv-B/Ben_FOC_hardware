my first FOC board
This is my first FOC PCB board. When I drew this, I mainly imitated ODrive and TI's BOOSTXL-DRV8323RS, and also borrowed from moteus and simpleFOC. I used STM32F405RGT6 and DRV8323RS smart gate driver on this board, and my goal is to simply drive a single motor. I hope this board can work properly at a current of 50A, and I hope its power supply voltage is about 24V (I am not familiar with the relationship between these specific drive voltages and currents, and I will realize it when I use it in the future). This is my first board that I just drew, and it passed the DRC check of Altium Designer. I want to produce it and use it soon. I hope that a senior can help me see what is wrong with this board. If you can help me point out the errors so that I can improve them, I will be very grateful.
